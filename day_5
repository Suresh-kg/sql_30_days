🚀 SQL Interview Problem – Daily Active Users (Netflix-Style Analytics)

DAU looks simple on paper…
but interviews test how precisely you define “active” 📊

🎯 Interview Problem

You’re given a user_activity table with user actions by date.

Task:
👉 Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)
👉 Then compute the rolling 7-day average of DAU

📌 Strict Business Rules (Very Important)

A user is active if they appear at least once per day
Count distinct users per day
Rolling window = current day + previous 6 days

Output:

activity_date
daily_active_users
rolling_7_day_avg

🧠 How Interviewers Expect You to Think

This problem is not about writing a long query.
It tests whether you can:
Clearly define DAU
Avoid double-counting users
Apply a time-based rolling window
Separate daily aggregation from trend analysis

💡 The key insight:

First calculate DAU per day,
then apply a 7-day rolling average on top of it.

📊 Why This Matters in Real Products

Streaming and consumer apps use this exact logic to:
Track engagement trends
Smooth daily fluctuations
Measure product health over time

If you understand this well,
you’re thinking like a product data analyst, not just writing SQL.

📌 Interview Tip:
Most candidates jump straight to the rolling window.
Strong candidates define DAU correctly first.
