🚀 **Day 11 – Meta SQL Interview (User Engagement)**

## 📌 Business Problem
Meta wants to identify **highly engaged users**.

A user is considered **highly engaged** if:
* They were active for **at least 5 consecutive calendar days**

Used for:

* Retention analysis
* Power-user detection
* Notification targeting

## 🎯 Interview Task

**Find users who were active for at least 5 consecutive days.**

## 🔒 Rules (Meta-Style Precision)

* Consecutive = **calendar days**
* Multiple activities on the same day count as **one**
* Use `activity_date`
* Output only `user_id`
* Each user appears once

  ## 📌 Why This Is a Strong Interview Answer

* Correctly **deduplicates daily activity**
* Uses **gaps & islands** for streak detection
* Avoids overcounting
* Scales cleanly to real engagement data
