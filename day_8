🚀 Day 8 – Uber SQL Interview (Advanced+)

This is where most candidates slip.
Not because SQL is hard —
but because date logic is unforgiving 😈

📌 Business Problem

Uber wants to identify drivers who were inactive for exactly 7 consecutive days and then became active again.

Used for:

Churn & reactivation analysis

Incentive targeting

Driver lifecycle modeling

🎯 Interview Question

Find drivers who had a gap of exactly 7 inactive days between two consecutive rides.

🔒 Strict Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Compare consecutive rides only
Use ride_date (not ride_id)

“Exactly 7 inactive days” means:
next_ride_date − current_ride_date − 1 = 7

👉 Which translates to a date difference of 8 days

Output only driver_id

Each driver appears once


📌 Why This Is an Advanced Question

Tests LEAD / LAG on real timelines

Exposes off-by-one errors

Forces you to think in inactive days, not date gaps

Mimics real churn reactivation logic

Most wrong answers use = 7.
Correct answers understand why it’s 8.

That’s the difference between:
❌ “knows SQL”
✅ “thinks like an analytics engineer”

More end-round SQL problems coming 🔥
👇 Would you catch the off-by-one trap?
