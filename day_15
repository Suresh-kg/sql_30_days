🚀 **Day 15 – Netflix SQL Interview (Churn Detection)**

Now we move beyond syntax.
This is **product analytics thinking + SQL**.


📌 Business Problem

Netflix wants to identify **churned users**.

A user is considered churned if:

* They were active before
* BUT have had **no activity in the last 30 days**

Assume today = **2024-02-15**

So any user whose last activity date is before **2024-01-16** is churned.

---

## 🎯 Interview Task

Find:

* `user_id`
* `last_activity_date`

Only churned users.

---

## 🧩 SQL Solution (Clean & Scalable)

```sql
SELECT
    user_id,
    MAX(activity_date) AS last_activity_date
FROM user_activity
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING MAX(activity_date) < '2024-01-16';
```

## 🧠 Why This Is a Senior-Level Question

This isn’t about window functions.

It tests whether you can:

* Translate business logic into date conditions
* Identify the correct aggregation level
* Avoid overengineering

Most candidates jump to `ROW_NUMBER()`.

Strong candidates ask:

> “Do I just need the latest activity?”

Sometimes the simplest query is the most powerful.

---

Churn logic like this powers:

* Retention dashboards
* Re-engagement campaigns
* Revenue forecasting

SQL becomes powerful when you think in **business terms first**.
