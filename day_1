🚀 Day 1 – SQL Interview Problem (Real Analytics Thinking)



Most SQL practice focuses on rows.

But interviews test whether you can think in trends 📈



Task:

👉 Find drivers whose total rides are strictly increasing month-over-month.



📊 Sample Data:



driver_id | ride_id | ride_date | city

101    | 1    | 2024-01-05 | Bangalore

101    | 2    | 2024-01-20 | Bangalore

101    | 3    | 2024-02-10 | Bangalore

101    | 4    | 2024-02-25 | Bangalore

101    | 5    | 2024-03-03 | Bangalore

102    | 6    | 2024-01-07 | Delhi

102    | 7    | 2024-03-12 | Delhi

103    | 8    | 2024-01-15 | Mumbai

103    | 9    | 2024-02-16 | Mumbai

103    | 10   | 2024-02-20 | Mumbai



🧠 How Interviewers Expect You to Think



This is not a simple GROUP BY.



You need to:

✅ Aggregate rides per driver per month

✅ Compare current month vs previous month

✅ Eliminate drivers with any decrease or no growth



💡 This is where window functions + validation logic matter.



✅ Final Output

driver_id

103





Only driver 103 shows a strictly increasing pattern across months.



🧩 SQL Solution (Interview-Ready)



SELECT driver_id

FROM (

  SELECT

    driver_id,

    date,

    cnt,

    CASE

      WHEN LAG(cnt) OVER (PARTITION BY driver_id ORDER BY date) IS NULL THEN 0

      WHEN cnt <= LAG(cnt) OVER (PARTITION BY driver_id ORDER BY date) THEN 1

      ELSE 0

    END AS is_bad

  FROM (

    SELECT

      driver_id,

      DATE_FORMAT(ride_date, '%Y-%m') AS date,

      COUNT(*) AS cnt

    FROM rides

    GROUP BY driver_id, DATE_FORMAT(ride_date, '%Y-%m')

  ) t

) x

GROUP BY driver_id

HAVING SUM(is_bad) = 0;



🔥 Why This Is an Interview-Level Problem



✔ Uses monthly aggregation

✔ Requires trend validation

✔ Tests LAG + logical filtering

✔ Mirrors real ride-analytics use cases



📌 Lesson:

SQL interviews are less about syntax and more about data thinking.



If you’re preparing for Data Analyst / Data Engineer roles,

practice problems like this — not just basic queries.
